# Course Performance Information Management System

## 1. Introduction

This project is the semester-long deliverable for CSC 472, focused on designing a Database Management System (DBMS) for a grading and feedback system. The project not only fulfills the course requirements but also aims to extend beyond the class to enhance our resumes and portfolios.

### Project Highlights:
1. **Design**: A DBMS for managing student performance data, developed as per Project 9.7 in the course project list.
2. **Components**:
   - **Course Component**: Satisfies the course objectives for CSC 472.
   - **Extended Component**: Adds further functionalities beyond the scope of the course to assist us in future job opportunities.
3. **Deliverables**: Includes all required design documents, reports, and project submissions. Post-course implementations may be done for portfolio purposes.
4. **Collaboration**: We use Discord for communication and GitHub for version control.

## 2. Project Overview

The DBMS is a **Course Performance Information Management System** designed to streamline the management of student grades. It includes:
- Input and storage of marks across multiple assessments.
- Dynamic addition of new assignments without predefined limits.
- Automated grade calculations based on preset weights.
- Customizable grading schemes, allowing instructors to set their own grade cutoffs.

## 3. Motivation

The traditional methods of maintaining student grades, such as using spreadsheets, are inefficient, especially in larger classes. This project aims to address those shortcomings by providing:
- **Efficiency**: Automated grading processes save time.
- **Flexibility**: Instructors can add assessments dynamically.
- **Accuracy**: Ensures error-free grade calculations.
- **Customization**: Adapts to various course structures and grading criteria.

## 4. Benefits

This project brings significant improvements in managing grading and feedback:
1. **Efficiency**: Automates tedious tasks like grade calculations.
2. **Convenience**: Provides instant access to student grades and feedback.
3. **Redundancy**: Increases security and reduces the risk of grade tampering.
4. **Data-Driven Insights**: Facilitates better decision-making with more detailed student performance data.

## 5. Project Timeline

Our project will follow these key steps:
1. **Brainstorming**: Identifying elements necessary for automating the grading and feedback process.
2. **Table Creation**: Designing database tables to organize and categorize relevant data.
3. **Normalization**: Removing redundant data and ensuring proper data dependencies.
4. **Schema Design**: Developing the data model and storage requirements.
5. **Project Review Report**: Documenting methodologies, challenges, and insights gained from the project.

## 6. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is critical to the success and longevity of this system. The project will include:
1. **DBMS Design Overview**: A detailed breakdown of the systemâ€™s structure.
2. **Design Rationale**: Explanation of key design decisions.
3. **Iterative Changes**: Record of modifications made throughout the project.
4. **Timeline and Updates**: A project journal to track progress and changes.
